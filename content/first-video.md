I've just uploaded my second ever Youtube video! I've been procrastinating on this for over a month, but this is a video of me tackling the [Mars Rover Kata](https://danilsuits.github.io/mars-rover-kata/) in Typescript. Most versions of this I've seen use an outside-in style, but instead I'm using a bottom-up approach. I'd love feedback, on Youtube or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bob_the_mighty). If people are interested, I've got two more parts to edit and upload.
